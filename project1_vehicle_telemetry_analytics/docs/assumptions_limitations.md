# Assumptions & Limitations

---

## Assumptions

- Telemetry is time-ordered and sampled at reasonable rates
- Synthetic data represents plausible physical behavior
- Thresholds are illustrative and configurable
- SQL database is used for analytics persistence

---

## Limitations

- Not intended for real-time or safety-critical use
- FFT analysis is simplified (no windowing or advanced spectral methods)
- Does not include anomaly detection or ML classification
- Assumes clean time synchronization across signals

---

## Intended Use

- Analytics architecture demonstration
- Engineering analytics reference
- BI integration example
